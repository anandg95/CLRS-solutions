Since there are lots of problems spread across files:

1. Basic tree building, initialization, insertion, deletion and searching - [bst.py](/Ch12/bst.py)
2. Insertion by recursion - [bst.py](/Ch12/bst.py)
3. Minimum and maximum in a subtree - [bst.py](/Ch12/bst.py)
4. Recursive inorder, postorder and preorder traversals - [bst.py](/Ch12/bst.py)
5. Iterative inorder, preorder and postorder traversals. This includes the 1 stack and 2 stack versions of postorder traversal as well - [bst_iterative.py](/Ch12/bst_iterative.py)
6. Inorder and preorder traversal without using an auxiliary data structure - [bst_morris.py](/Ch12/bst_morris.py)
7. Inorder, preorder and postorder successors and predecessors of node in BST - [bst_succ_pred.py](/Ch12/bst_succ_pred.py)
8. Height of bst iterative and recursive - [bst_height.py](/Ch12/bst_height.py)
9. Level order traversal of BST, iterative and recursive - [bst_level_order.py](/Ch12/bst_level_order.py)
10. Least common ancestor of binary tree as well as binary search tree - [bst_misc.py](/Ch12/bst_misc.py)
11. Equality of 2 binary trees - [bst_misc.py](/Ch12/bst_misc.py)
12. Size of a binary tree - [bst_misc.py](/Ch12/bst_misc.py)
13. Given root of a BST and a sum, find a path from root to any leaf whose sum of nodes is the given sum -  [bst_misc.py](/Ch12/bst_misc.py)
14. Check BST property in a binary tree -  [bst_misc.py](/Ch12/bst_misc.py)
